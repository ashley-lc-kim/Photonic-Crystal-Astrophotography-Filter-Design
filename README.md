# PhotonicCrystal-Astro-Filter-Design

## Abstract
Several astrophotography filters are currently used to isolate the targeted wavelength of H-alpha, O3, and H-beta for a clearer capture of nebulae; however they fail to achieve both highest possible transmittance and low focus band width. This paper presents a novel nebula filter incorporating three 1-dimensional photonic crystal created through deposited layers of TiO2 and SiO2. The design was able to achieve **97.9 percent transmittance rate** in 656.3 nm wavelength of H-alpha, as well as **Full Width at Half Max (FWHM) of mere 0.1 nm**, while blocking almost every other wavelength of the visible light spectrum. This filter design is a clear improvement from any other currently existing products and shows high applicability due to its relatively uncomplicated depositing structure and its flexibility from the possible algorithmic manipulation of the targeted wavelengths. 

## Photonic Crystals
The Photonic Crystal is an optical nanostructure that contains periodic variations of the refractive index. Its unique composition and structure give rise to its optical characteristics, mainly the ability to control the propagation of different wavelengths of electromagnetic light. For certain wavelengths of light, photonic crystals prevent its propagation in any direction within the material. This certain "gap," or range in wavelength, is named the photonic crystal band gap, due to its similar properties with the electronic band gap of semiconductors. The band gap of photonic crystals can be manipulated through various factors such as the refractive index and width of the materials, as well as the system and periodicity of the alternating layers.

## Details of filter
The two materials used for this filter is TiO2 and SiO2. The design of the filter composes of 3 distinct layers deposited on top of each other. The first layer is a 1D photonic crystal with one defect, while the second and third are 1D photonic crystal without any defects in their band gap. 

## Methods
To analyze the performance of each prototype, the transfer matrix method (TMM) was employed. TMM is a method used in optics to analyze the propagation of electromagnetic waves through multi-layer of thin films of different material. It consists of writing the Maxwellâ€™s equations in the k-space and rewriting them, performing the operation with layer-by-layer calculations.
